## 1. Introduction
This paper presents a benchmark, DebugEval, which is used to evaluate the code debugging ability of LLMs (Large Language Models) and proposals a framework for synthesizing training data using multiple agents, COAST.

### 1.1 DEBUGEVAL
#### DebugEval designs four task scenarios: BUG Localization, BUG Identification, Code Repair, and Code Review to comprehensively evaluate the code debugging capability of LLMs.

### 1.2 COAST
#### COAST is a framework for making use of multiple agents working together to synthesize training data to improve code debugging capability of LLMs.

## 2. Installation
You can clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/NEUIR/COAST
cd COAST
```

## 3. Inference and Evaluation
Download the dataset we provide.

```
cd src
```
Please refer to `src/README.md` for more details.
## 4. Fine-Tuning
We use DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Ins and Llama3-8B-Ins as the base model, and train the models with MASTER framework.

### 4.1 For DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Ins
```
cd neural_compiler
```
Please refer to `neural_compiler/README.md` for more details.
### 4.2 For Llama3-8B-Ins
```
cd LLaMA-Factory
```
Please refer to `LLaMA-Factory/README.md` for more details.

We provide the trained NeuDebugger models.
